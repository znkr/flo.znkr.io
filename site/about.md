I like work to with computers in my spare time as well as for work. It's been my hobby forever, but
I never really wrote about what I was doing, because it's usually only to satisfy my own curiosity
or to solve some very specific problems I have. In short, nothing great (or even halfway finished)
has ever come out of that.

Professionally, I am a software engineer and worked in a number of fields from image and video
processing to distributed systems. My employer for the last many years is Google where I lead the
team responsible for making Go available inside Google's monorepo, make Google Go developers
productive, and improving the efficiency of Go software running in Google's fleet. To avoid any
confusion, this team is not part of the official Go language team, but we work closely with them.

This blog is an experiment to see if what I do privately is of interest to anyone. That is, this is
my *personal* blog and all views on this site are my own and not those of my employer.

If you want to contact me, you can write me an email by replacing the first `.` in this domain with
an `@` to get my email address.
