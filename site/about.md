I am a computer nerd and like to work with computers in my spare time as well as for work. This
blog is an experiment to see if what I do privately is of interest to anyone.

Professionally, I am a software engineer and worked in a number of fields from image and video
processing to distributed systems. My employer for the last many years is Google where I lead the
team responsible for making Go available inside Google's monorepo, make Google Go developers
productive, and improving the efficiency of Go software running in Google's fleet. To avoid any
confusion, this team is not part of the official Go language team, but we work closely with them.

That said, this is my *personal* blog and all views on this site are my own and not those of my
employer.
